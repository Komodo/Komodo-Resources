            This extension provides helper tools for working with JavaScript and Python inside of Komodo.

            If you want to play around with the JavaScript API, do some simple python coding tests, probe the Komodo API for an extension, or play with the internals of Komodo, then this is for you!

            Brief guide:

              * Once installed, access it through the Tools-&gt;Extension Developer menu
              * When working with the JavaScript tools, you'll generally want to set the Scope to be the main Komodo window first, otherwise the Komodo API won't be available to you.
              * Use Tab for completions on objects and scope, fantastic!

            Note: This extension is based upon Ted Mielczarek's \"Extension Developer's Extension\", information is found here:

            The only differences between this version and Ted's is:

              * Updated to include a Komodo overlay
              * Includes the Python Shell, this requires PyXPCOM (already provided by Komodo).

            **Updates**

              * 5th July 2011
            \- Make compatible with Komodo 7
              * 18th March 2010
            \- Automatically set the JS Shell to the scope of the opening window
            \- Remember (persist) the shell dialog size

            This extension provides a server tree row, one for each of your server accounts set in server preferences.

            The server tree rows are expandable and upon selection of a server tree row, the file contents will be displayed in a file tree (located just below the server tree).

            The file tree rows can be selected and the correstponding files can be opened by double-clicking a row or by pressing the enter key.
