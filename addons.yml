              Here is an extension that provides a servers tab inside of Komodo
              (installed after the Code Browser tab).
              
              This extension provides a server tree row, one for each of your
              server accounts set in server preferences.
              
              The server tree rows are expandable and upon selection of a server
              tree row, the file contents will be displayed in a file tree
              (located just below the server tree).
              
              The file tree rows can be selected and the correstponding files
              can be opened by double-clicking a row or by pressing the enter key.
