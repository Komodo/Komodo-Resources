            Currently you can use the following snippets to add params to your

            abbreviations folder):

            -   phpdoc\_function
            -   phpdoc\_class
            -   phpdoc\_var

            You will have to include the star symbol (\*) in front of every line and
            you'll probably want to check the \"Maintain indentation context after
            insertion\" option.

            Will toggle the comments for the selected editor lines (or current
            line). I use Ctrl+3 (overriding the default cmd_comment keybinding)
            to invoke this macro, then I never need to use Ctrl+2
            (cmd_uncomment) at all.

            ## Usage
            1. Install the Macro (drag the .komodotool into your toolbox)
            2. Assign a Keybind to your macro (right click > Properties > Key Binding)
            3. Execute the macro with your keybinding.
